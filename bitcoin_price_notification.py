To create a Python program for bitcoin price notification, we'll need to use an API to fetch the latest bitcoin price and then set up a notification system to alert 
the user when the price reaches a certain threshold. In this example, we'll use the Coinbase API to get the bitcoin price and the plyer library for 
desktop notifications.

pip install requests plyer

Here's a basic example for the bitcoin price notification program:


import requests
from plyer import notification
import time

def get_bitcoin_price():
    url = 'https://api.coinbase.com/v2/prices/BTC-USD/spot'
    response = requests.get(url)
    data = response.json()
    bitcoin_price = float(data['data']['amount'])
    return bitcoin_price

def send_notification(price_threshold):
    bitcoin_price = get_bitcoin_price()
    if bitcoin_price >= price_threshold:
        notification_title = 'Bitcoin Price Alert'
        notification_message = f'Bitcoin price has reached ${price_threshold:.2f}!'
        notification.notify(title=notification_title, message=notification_message)

def main():
    price_threshold = 60000  # Set your desired price threshold here
    interval_minutes = 5    # Set the interval for checking the price (in minutes)

    while True:
        send_notification(price_threshold)
        time.sleep(interval_minutes * 60)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

In this example, we have defined two functions. The get_bitcoin_price function fetches the latest bitcoin price from the Coinbase API, and the send_notification function sends a desktop notification if the price reaches the specified threshold.

You can customize the price_threshold variable to set your desired price threshold for receiving notifications. The program will check the bitcoin price at regular intervals (defined by interval_minutes) and send a notification if the price is equal to or higher than the threshold.

Please note that this is a basic example, and in a real-world scenario, you might want to use a more reliable and real-time API for fetching bitcoin prices. Additionally, the program currently runs indefinitely; you may add further functionality to stop the notification loop based on user input or a certain condition.
